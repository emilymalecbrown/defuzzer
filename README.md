This is an unfinished guessing game - similar to Pictionary, but with no drawing (pre-loaded images). Only functions now as a super basic chat app. You can create rooms, share links, and chat with friends. 

The realtime chat capabilities are powered by WebSockets and Firebase, and the site is [deployed](https://defuzzer.ue.r.appspot.com/room/f5abbb7d-2190-4d5a-b97a-2429b2c9edbd) on App Engine.

Was built for fun over the holidays to get a sense of Google Cloud and developing on the M1 chip. My favorite part was the WebSockets.
